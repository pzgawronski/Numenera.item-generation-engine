1,55,Device enhancer,"If affixed to another cypher or artifact, that device is enhanced in one of the following ways (roll a d6):
1 The device now also inflicts 4 points of damage if used on a target other than the user. If the device already inflicts damage, the damage is increased by 2 points. If used on an artifact, this effect lasts for 28hours after the first use.
2 The device, when activated, also projects a force field around the user that lasts for an hour. This field provides +2 to Armor. If the device already creates protective Armor, that Armor gains +1 instead. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact.
3 The device, when activated, also adds 1 to the user’s Might Edge, Speed Edge, and Intellect Edge for one hour. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact.
4 If the device has immediate range, the range is increased to short. If short, it is increased to long. If long, it is increased to 61 m. Such changes to the device last for 28 hours. If the device does not have a ranged effect, it instead affects the user when activated so that the user moves a long distance on an action for 28 hours. This latter effect can be used once.
5 The device, when activated, also makes the user invisible for an hour. While invisible the user is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if he does something to reveal his presence or position – attacking, performing an esotery, using an ability, and so on. If this occurs, he can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding his position. This functions once, regardless of whether the enhanced device is a cypher or an artifact.
6 The device now also restores a total of 4 points each time it is activated. The user can allocate those points among his stat Pools as desired, but the Pools cannot go above their maximum.

2,55,Shock nodule,"For the next 28 hours, each time the weapon the nodule is attached to strikes a solid creature or object, it generates a burst of electricity, inflicting 1 additional point of damage (2 points if the cypher is level 4 or higher, 3 points if the cypher is level 6 or higher).",1d6,Crystal nodule affixed to a melee weapon,,,,,,,
2,56,Sidestep portal,"The user steps sideways and disappears into an extradimensional space, where she can remain for as long as she wishes. The space is an empty void of pale grey light in which the user floats. She can perceive nothing outside this space, and nothing outside it can perceive her. She experiences the passage of time and may act normally while in the space, though it cannot connect to the datasphere or interact with the world outside in any way.
When the user emerges from the space, she returns to the spot she left or an open space nearest to that spot, and the extradimensional space vanishes. Anything left in the space is lost.",1d6,Cloak,Cape,Bodysuit,Piece of cloth,,,,

2,72,Stone guts,"Any time within 1d6 hours after activating the device, the user can vomit the contents of his stomach anywhere within immediate range. The liquid hardens to the consistency of concrete within a few seconds of being exposed to air. The amount of vomit is enough to cover a human-sized creature. A covered target cannot move until it breaks free or someone else frees it by shattering the rocklike shell. The difficulty of this task is equal to the cypher level.",1d6,Pill,Ingestible liquid,Injector,,,,,
2,73,Store-all,"A user can pull and stretch the box, increasing its dimensions to a maximum size of a 15 m cube. The container’s size can only be increased, not decreased, and once stretched out, it can never be restored to its original size.

2,75,Swarm herder,"The device launches a tiny pointed capsule that moves at great speed. If it hits a living creature, it punctures the skin or exoskeleton and explodes, instantly releasing a compound of pheromones and impulsecontrolling nanites. In response, the creature attempts to round up other members of its herd or group and move them away from combat to an area of perceived safety. If the creature is solitary, the cypher has no effect (or may cause it to attempt to round up whatever other creatures are nearby, including the PCs, as though they were part of its herd). The effect lasts for ten minutes.",1d6,Adheres to temple and launches projectile,Handheld device that launches projectile,,,,,,
2,76,Talio's compass,"Pinpoints a source of metal within living tissue and can draw it out. If used to remove a dangerous object (such as a projectile) from a living creature, the device restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the creature’s Might Pool.
If used to discover and remove a beneficial or benign object (such as an implant) from a living creature, the device does 2 points of damage.",1d6,Handheld device,,,,,,,
2,77,Task drone,"When activated, this drone flies up to a long distance and performs one simple task with its tendril arm, such as pull a lever, open a door, lift an object, or push an object. Returning to the user can be a part of the task (so the drone can go get something and return with it). The drone has the strength of a normal human and is a creature of a level equal to the cypher level, with 1 Armor. It cannot make attacks and ceases to function after it performs its single task.",1d6,Small winged device with a tendril anding in a hand,,,,,,,
2,78,Tether,"Fires a metal spike at a target within range that inflicts 2 points of damage. Then, as part of the same action, the spike shoots a second metal spike at a different target within immediate range of it that inflicts the same damage. The spikes are connected by a tether. Until either target uses an action to remove the spike, neither target can move away from the other.",1d6,Handheld proejctor (short range),,,,,,,
2,79,Third man,"When activated, the device creates the perception of an unseen presence among the party. This presence provides a sense of comfort and support to all members of the group (except the one who activated the device), giving them each an asset to a task of their choosing for one hour.",1d6,Handheld device,,,,,,,
2,80,Three-part alarm,"When activated, three sensor pieces detach from the main device. Each piece can be placed anywhere within 1 km of the main device.

2,88,Transformation torque,"Placing the necklace around your neck activates the device, which then sends small projections (similar to cilia) beneath the skin. These projections release a genetic compound that causes a mutation in the wearer for one hour.
Additionally, the necklace houses a visage changer, which allows the wearer to hide his mutation if desired. If that’s the case, the wearer gets the effects of the mutation but others cannot see, hear, or otherwise sense the mutation. Different necklaces have different effects. Roll d100:
01–50 Causes a beneficial mutation
51–80 Causes a powerful mutation
81–90 Causes a harmful mutation

2,93,Vision subjugator,"Inhibits brain function in a target within short range for one hour so that the target’s vision is affected. The user can specify one category of creatures, objects, substances, and so on that the victim cannot see. The effect is extremely specific, so that if “humans” are selected, the victim cannot see people but would still see clothing worn, objects carried, and so on. Possible categories might include (but are not limited to): metal, vapor, water, mammals, synth, weapons, numenera, the color blue, and plants. It’s worth noting that this does not grant the victim X-ray vision. If he cannot see stone and he stands next to a stone wall, his brain creates what he sees instead out of whole cloth based on the context of what he can see. This can lead to seriously delusional behavior.",1d6,Ingestible liquid,Injector,,,,,,
2,94,Visual displacement device,Projects holographic images of the wearer to confuse attackers. The images appear around the wearer. This gives the wearer an asset to Speed defense actions for ten minutes per cypher level.,1d6,Belt,Bracelet,Handheld device,,,,,

3,1,Weaver drone,"Responding to simple voice commands, the weaver drone can climb almost any surface, releasing the strong synth cable out behind it as it travels in a simple or complex pattern. Once the cable runs out, the drone anchors itself (and the end of the cable) to a designated place and shuts down permanently. As long as the cable is anchored by the drone, it can sustain the weight of up to two average-sized people at a time.",1d6,A spiderlike automaton equipped with a 15 m spool of strong synth cable,,,,,,,
3,2,Witless powder,"To activate the device, the user blows through one end of the tube to propel the cartridge’s contents out the other at a creatue within immediate range. If the creature is hit by the powder, and its level is equal to or lower than the cypher level, it becomes stunned for one minute. During this time, if the user speaks to the target in a language the target can understand, she can implant a suggestion in the target’s mind. This suggestion is a course of activity the target must follow under the specific conditions the user describes. The course of activity can be anything she chooses, though it cannot be anything that poses a significant risk to the target’s life, property, or loved ones. The conditions can be as general or as specific as the user decides. If the described conditions happen during the next 28 hours, the target behaves as instructed.",1d6,A thin metal tube with a fragile powder cartridge in the center,,,,,,,
3,3,Wrist launcher,"Launches a small object (such as a dart, a stone, or a detonation cypher) up to long range. If the object is hard (preferably pointed), it inflicts 4 points of damage. A detonation inflicts its own explosive damage.",1d6,Wrist-mounted device,,,,,,,
3,4,Access glasses,"Goggles plus gloves or rings Effect: The user can see through up to half an inch of solid material and can pass his hands and anything his hands are holding through that solid matter. Once the area to be looked and passed through is chosen – about 18 inches by 18 inches (46 cm by 46 cm) – a new area cannot be chosen. However, the effect lasts for an hour.",1d6+1,Goggles + gloves/rings,,,,,,,
3,5,Adamant foam,"The foam in this canister is extraordinarily light – almost weightless, lighter than a soap bubble – and virtually invisible. It’s possible, in fact, to have this foam in your hand and not even realize it. And yet the foam, which dries on contact with the air, is superstrong. While pliable, it’s as unbreakable as steel mesh. The canister has enough foam to coat an area 2 m by 2 m with a thin layer.
Although this foam has many uses, if sprayed on a living target, that target has +2 to Armor.
Adamant foam disintegrates after 28 hours.",1d6+1,Small spray canister,,,,,,,
3,6,Blood boiler,Causes an increase in blood flow to any stimulated body parts. Adds 1 to Might Edge for one hour.,1d6+1,Pill,Ingestible liquid,,,,,,
3,7,Blue crystal,"When one gazes through a blue crystal, for a brief moment she can view a spot corresponding to her current position in a parallel universe. Moreover, the view is set a few moments in the future. However, since the crystal shows a parallel universe, the future seen may or may not be an accurate reflection of her reality. The user, then, sees a possible future. Normally, there is about a 30% chance that the glimpse is entirely accurate and a 30% chance that it is partially accurate, but these numbers depend on the circumstances.",1d6+1,Small blue crystal,,,,,,,
3,8,Camouflage spray,An inanimate object (or group of objects) small enough to fit into a cube that is 3 m by 3 m by 3 m can be quickly coated so that its color and texture blend into its surroundings perfectly.,1d6+1,Canister,,,,,,,
3,9,Clamp trap,"When activated, this device becomes a pressure-plate trap that clamps around anything that triggers it. The device is similar to a bear trap, except that when it is fully activated, it becomes invisible. Once triggered,it inflicts damage equal to the cypher level, plus 1 additional point of damage per minute until it is removed.",1d6+1,Mouthlike metal clamp,,,,,,,
3,10,Communication discs,"These cyphers usually come in pairs (although each is its own cypher). They allow verbal communication between their users at any distance. Both cyphers must be activated at the same time, and they function for 28 hours.",1d6+1,Small synth discs,,,,,,,
3,11,Comprehension graft,"When applied to a creature’s head, the disc immediately unleashes microfilaments that enter the brain. Within five minutes, the creature can understand the words of a specific language keyed to the graft (two languages if the cypher is level 5 or higher). This is true even of creatures that do not normally have a language. If the creature could already understand the language, the cypher has no effect. Once the graft attaches, the effect is permanent, and this device no longer counts against the number of cyphers that a PC can bear.",1d6+1,Small metallic disc,,,,,,,
3,12,Construction foam,"The canister produces a vast amount of foam. This foam can easily be shaped into whatever form the user wishes that equals about four 3 m cubes – the size of a small house or a wall that’s 0.3 m, 3 m high, and 122 m long. This probably takes about twenty minutes. The foam dries quickly (in about a half hour) and hardens to the strength of steel, but it remains fairly lightweight. The entire mass of hardened foam weighs about 91 kg.",1d6+1,Large canister,,,,,,,
3,13,Distance activator,"When the nodule is detached and connected to any other cypher, the user of the distance activator can activate that cypher from a range of up to 2 km.",1d6+1,"Handheld device with a small, detachable nodule",,,,,,,
3,14,Duplicator,"When one end of the device is touched against a creature, a mass of gelatin sprays out the other end. Within three rounds, the gelatin creates what appears to be an exact living copy of the touched creature, including clothing and equipment, but it’s a spongy facade. The copy is a level 1 creature with minimal intelligence that follows simple commands, but complex thought and emotions are beyond its capabilities. The copy lasts up to 28 hours, at which time it melts and evaporates.",1d6+1,"Synth cylinder etched with fine, glowing lines",,,,,,,
3,15,Ejection nodule,"For the next hour, each time the weapon the nodule is attached to strikes a solid creature or object hard enough to inflict damage (but no more than once per round), the target of the strike teleports to a random location within a radius of 100 × the cypher level in feet.",1d6+1,Crystal nodule affixed to a melee weapon,,,,,,,
3,16,Eyestalk graft,"This organic object grafts directly and immediately onto the flesh of the user’s head. The eyestalk functions for 28 hours, during which time the user has an asset for all perception tasks and can look surreptitiously around corners.",1d6+1,A large bulbous eye with a 15 cm stalk,,,,,,,
3,17,Fangs of the Reaver,"Upon activation, the sphere opens to reveal nasty metal teeth. It flies at a single target within short range that the user chooses, and it attacks as a creature of a level equal to the cypher level. It continues to attack that target for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level or until the target is dead, whichever comes first.",1d6+1,5 cm metal sphere,,,,,,,
3,18,Flow,"Enables the user to move more rapidly by harnessing momentum gained from movement.

The effect wears off after one hour.",1d6+1,Pill,Ingestible liquid,Ingestible powder,,,,,
3,19,Foam limb,"If sprayed upon a creature, the foam builds an arm with a hand that mimics one of the creature’s existing limbs in appearance, if possible. (If not applicable, the default limb is a long, sinewy arm with a three-fingered hand.) The foam arm hardens to the consistency of the creature’s flesh and can be used by the creature as if it were its own. The new arm does not grant the creature additional actions or attacks in a round, but it can be useful for carrying things. If the arm is harmed, the creature suffers no ill effect. The arm lasts for 28 hours.",1d6+1,Canister,,,,,,,
3,20,Foam sprayer,"This device sprays foam on a target within immediate range. There is enough foam to cover up to three humans standing next to each other (or one larger target). Different kinds of foam have different effects. Roll a d6 to determine the foam in a given canister:
1 Hardens: All movement is halved, and the difficulty of all physical actions is increased by two steps for ten minutes.
2 Caustic: The foam burns like acid, inflicting 4 points of damage on the first round and 2 points of damage on the second round before becoming harmless.
3 Caustic and hardens: All movement is halved, the difficulty of all physical actions is increased by two steps for ten minutes, and the target suffers 4 points of damage.
4 Dampens energy: If sprayed upon any numenera item (or if the target is in possession of numenera items), the item’s effective level is lowered by 4 for ten minutes. If this effect reduces the level of the item to 0, the item will not function for that time. Nonpowered numenera items, like pills, are not affected.
5 Dissolves metal: The level of a metal item covered in the foam is lowered by 4 permanently. If this effect reduces the level of the metal to 0, the item is destroyed.
6 Dissolves metal and dampens energy: The level of a metal item covered in the foam is lowered by 4 permanently. If this effect reduces the level of the metal to 0, the item is destroyed. Numenera items coated by the foam also have their level effectively lowered by 4 for ten minutes. If this effect reduces the level of the item to 0 or less, the item will not function for that time. Nonpowered numenera items, like pills, are not dampened.",1d6+1,Canister,,,,,,,
3,21,Ghostly duplicate,"When activated, an incorporeal duplicate of the user appears and remains for ten minutes. The duplicate does not have a mind of its own. Rather, the user controls both forms, but only one at a time. Switching consciousness between forms is an action. While the user’s consciousness focuses on one form, the other stands motionless. The duplicate moves at the same speed as the user’s normal form, but there is no limit to how far apart the two can be.
The duplicate is ghostly and translucent. It can pass through solid matter and cannot be harmed except by special transdimensional weapons and effects. It likewise cannot affect normal matter in any way. While moving as the incorporeal duplicate, the user gains an asset for all stealth tasks.
When the duplicate’s duration ends (or it is somehow destroyed), the user’s mind returns to his normal body. If the normal body is slain, the user stays in the duplicate, but only for the remaining duration.",1d6+1,Bracelet,Necklace,Ring,Handheld device,,,,
3,22,Glass flame pellets,"If thrown – as a group – at the floor, the pellets burst into flame, filling the immediate area with fierce flames that burn for 28 hours, inflicting 6 points of damage to anyone in or passing through the area. There is just barely enough time for a character to drop the pellets and move out of the area of the fire in one action.",1d6+1,Handful of glass pellets,,,,,,,
3,23,Glass scorpion,"When activated, the glass scorpion immediately moves in the direction it is pointed until it comes upon a living creature at least the size of a hound. It then attacks with the needlelike stinger in its tail as a creature of a level equal to the cypher level. The scorpion injects a poison that inflicts 3 points of damage per round for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level.",1d6+1,Small scorpion made of glass,,,,,,,
3,24,Grub armor,"This cypher requires a bit of water to activate the dried worms in the can. Once activated, the grubs grow to enormous size in 1d6 rounds and swarm over the user’s body, providing +2 to Armor for one hour. Further, if the user is targeted by an effect that specifically affects a single creature, such as something that controls or reads her mind, one of the grubs is affected instead, effectively rendering the user immune to such things for the duration. This does not apply to straightforward physical attacks of any kind.",1d6+1,Canister of dried worms,,,,,,,
3,25,Healing nodule,"Once activated, this nodule functions for ten minutes. Whenever the weapon that the nodule is affixed to strikes a foe (or any hard surface), 1 point is restored to the wielder’s Might Pool. The nodule cannot restore more than 1 point per round.",1d6+1,Crystal nodule affixed to a melee weapon,,,,,,,

3,27,Heat sheath,"This spray can coat up to one melee weapon per cypher level, but all of the canister’s contents must be sprayed at once. Coated weapons inflict 1 additional point of damage from the heat they now generate. The coating wears off after 28 hours.",1d6+1,Spray canister,,,,,,,
3,28,Helping hand,"When activated, the hand hovers near the user for 28 hours. During that time, it acts as the user’s third hand – holding objects, opening doors, turning dials, and so on. The helping hand can also make attacks as the user might, with weapons provided to it, but all such attacks are modified by two steps to the user’s detriment.",1d6+1,"A metallic, seven-fingered hand",,,,,,,
3,29,Hover disc,"The user can stand on the disc, and for ten minutes it moves as she desires, up to a long distance each round. In a combat situation, she can take an action (other than moving) and still move a long distance. Because the disc is attuned to her thoughts, falling off is possible only if she loses consciousness or is struck by a tremendous force (usually one that inflicts more than 8 points of damage in one blow).",1d6+1,A metal disc 60 cm across,,,,,,,
3,30,Instant companion,"If submerged in water, the pod grows quickly.

The bolt inflicts damage equal to the cypher level, but the jolter is difficult to aim or control. The difficulty for any attack with the device is increased by one step, and a roll of 1 or 2 on the die suggests that a different target (if any) was struck. The jolter emits the bolt for four rounds, each round inflicting the same damage, but using it each round is an action and requires a new roll. There is no way to turn the jolter off once activated, so activating it is a four-round commitment.

5,24,Summoning staff,"This device requires two separate actions to fully activate. The first action involves the small cylinder, which has a glass lens on one end. With the cylinder, the user locates a random ultraterrestrial being (whose level is equal to or less than the cypher level) dwelling somewhere other than the Ninth World. The being becomes visible in the lens. On the next action, the user can use the staff to open a portal and pull the ultraterrestrial into this world.
The ultraterrestrial cannot resist, but once it arrives, it is not automatically compelled
to do anything. Unless it can return under its own power or through some other means, it is in this world to stay.When the user finds an ultraterrestrial in the first step of this process, he can choose not to bring it into this world, but he cannot use the device to find another being.",1d6+3,Metallic staff with a small attached cylinder,,,,,,,

5,33,Burrowing bubble,"Upon activation, for ten minutes, the user is surrounded by a bubble of energy that projects incredible heat outward, but not inward. This bubble floats 0.3 m in the air, inflicts 6 points of damage to all within immediate range, and inflicts 3 points of damage to all within short range. Further, it instantly melts the material directly below (of lower level than the cypher), and the bubble sinks an immediate distance into the new hole it created. This continues for the duration of the effect, so a user who stands on the ground when activating this cypher ends up about 244 m underground when it finally stops.
If the user concentrates, she can force the bubble to move an immediate distance in any direction she chooses as an action.
The user cannot penetrate the bubble, and neither can forces from the outside. Not even ambient damage gets through. Dealing at least 50 points of damage to the bubble (which has no Armor) destroys it. Damaging the bubble does not harm the user inside until the bubble is destroyed, at which point she falls from whatever height the bubble was at, which is at least 0.3 m in the air.",1d6+4,Ring,Bracelet,Headband,Handheld device,,,,
5,34,Camouflage screen,"Projects an opaque, two-dimensional screen of light that is 4 m high and 6 m across. It lasts up to 28 hours. The screen bears an animate image appropriate to the surrounding area, such as trees and brush in a forest, sandy dunes in a desert, and so on. Thus, anything behind the screen is easily hidden from visual observation unless the viewer is within immediate distance (and even then it may be obscured, depending on the circumstances).",1d6+4,Handheld device,,,,,,,
5,35,Caustic storm,"When activated, the cypher surrounds the user with a nimbus of energy, giving him +10 to Armor that works only against caustic damage. This lasts for one round, and the Armor is ablative, which is to say that each point of damage that it absorbs destroys 1 point of the Armor.
The cypher also releases fourteen hailstonesized motes of roiling caustic fluid that fly toward and attack all targets (including the user) within immediate range, one mote per target. If there are not fourteen targets within immediate range, the motes fly out to short range. If there are not fourteen targets within short range, they fly out to long range. If there are not fourteen targets within long range, the targets within long range get attacked twice (or more times) each, starting with those in immediate range.",1d6+4,Handheld device,,,,,,,
5,36,Cloud seed,"This device can be activated only outdoors and with a clear and unobstructed path to the sky. Once activated, a bright white mote flies up from the device into the sky and explodes, throwing grey tendrils out for 1 mile (2 km) in all directions. After one minute, the tendrils become dark clouds, and after another minute, the skies open up and drench the ground below with heavy rains. In freezing temperatures, the precipitation is sleet, ice, or snow. With the rain comes lightning and thunder. The storm moves with the prevailing winds and dissipates 1d6 hours later.",1d6+4,Handheld device (8 km),,,,,,,
5,37,Demonsphere,"This is a dangerous cypher to use, perhaps giving rise to its name. When activated, it creates a horrific sound, a combination of shrill shrieks and low rumbling (which also might account for its name). At the same time, red streaks of energy lance out at a number of intelligent targets within short range equal to the cypher level. If there are more targets than streaks of energy, the targets are determined randomly, meaning that the user could be a target.
The streaks of energy are extradimensional conduits tying the targets to an ultraterrestrial intelligence with a level equal to the cypher level. The intelligence attempts to control the targets’ actions for one round per cypher level. (Eligible targets include machine intelligences or any living creature more substantial than an insect.) The ultraterrestrial intelligence has a motive and understanding all its own, but it is utterly alien. Thus, it can do almost anything, but if desired, roll d100 each round instead:
Roll Target’s action
01–10 Scream
11–20 Make incomprehensible gestures
21–40 Attack the nearest creature
41–55 Attack the nearest object
56–60 Attack the ground
61–65 Activate the nearest numenera device
66–75 Run off as fast as possible
76–80 Begin speaking in an unknown language
81–83 Speak in the Truth and ask strange, random questions
84–85 Speak in the Truth and demand obedience
86–88 Examine a random object
89–90 Try to eat a random creature or object
91–93 Access unknown energies and teleport away
94–95 Access unknown energies and create a force field around itself
96–97 Access unknown energies and use them to attack all nearby

5,94,Fallback clone,"To activate this device, the user must place a few drops of blood, strands of hair, nail clippings, or a piece of flesh in a sealed, water-filled tank with one of the headbands and wear the other one. The headband in the tank facilitates the rapid growth of a clone in one month. The clone is a fully grown creature, identical in every physical way to the user. However, it has no consciousness and remains in a comatose state in the tank.
Once the clone has matured, if at any time the user dies while wearing the headband, her consciousness is transferred into the clone, regardless of distance. All skills, abilities, and knowledge are transferred.

5,100,Wish disk,"The user states a change in reality that she wishes to have happen, and it – or something very like it – occurs. This warping of reality can affect matter, energy, and time. Objects can be created or destroyed, creatures can be slain, and events from the past can be undone. Reality can be altered so that dead beings are still alive (because they never died). However, the minds of most users are insufficient to fully comprehend the vast implications of the reality they change. This means that the wish fulfillment may not be entirely what they thought it would be. The repercussions are too varied to list, but here are a few examples:
– A complex object created is brittle, of poor quality, or made of a substance that turns out to be dangerous.
– A significant change to the past results in a “bubble” of space-time in which the change occurred, trapping the user in a sort of limited closed dimension, even while normal, unchanged reality continues outside the bubble.
– Creatures altered by the change develop health issues ranging from new allergies or minor ailments to cancer or mutations.
– Minds altered by the change suffer from long-term trauma, confusion, memory loss, or brain damage.",10,A set of metal disks nested within each other,,,,,,,
